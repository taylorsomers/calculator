### By Taylor Somers

## Description

A website showcasing the basic JavaScript we have learned in our Epicodus class so far, in the form of an elementary calculator that uses JS prompts to collect two numbers in sequence and then either add, subtract, multiply, or divide them, and display the calculated result via an alert.
